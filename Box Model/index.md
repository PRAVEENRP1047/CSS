# Content & Sizing:

- Everything displayed by CSS is a box.
- Boxes have different behaviour based on their display property's value, their set dimensions
  and content they contain.
- The content can be a plain text or more boxes generated by child elements.
- In either of the above scenario, the content affects the size of the box.

## Extrinsic Vs Intrinsic sizing:

  - [Google's web.dev article](https://web.dev/learn/css/box-model)
  - When an element's dimension is set in CSS, then it is said to have extrinsic sizing.
  - In Extrinsic sizing, the box with set dimensions will control the content.
  - But even when extrinsic sizing is used above a threshold content overflows out of the box.
  - One way to instrinsically size the element would be to set the width of the box's width property
  to the value "min-content".
  - It means that the box should be as wide as the content inside it such that it wraps around it.
